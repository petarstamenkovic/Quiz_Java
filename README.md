# Quiz_Java

Second project from Java that features a simple Quiz game with **Client-Server architecure**. Run the server manually and clients connect to a same machine(this can be changed with simply adding the desired IP adress). In this code the following is covered : 
  1. Read and write questions and users from the encrypted file - I used symmetric encryption
  2. Client-Server communication with messages - I used BufferedReader/PrintWriter
  3. Shuffling and checking the validity of answers
  4. GUI for client (different for client that can be admin or contestant) - Due to lack of time and lot of exams, GUI is very plain and boring so dont judge me :D 
  5. Saving clients progress in a separate file and loading results back up if the same client logs back in
  6. Regullar expressions for valid password, username and role input.
  7. Multiple help is implemented (50/50 , ask a friend(other clinets) , question swap)
  8. Add/Remove players on the go (admin only)
  9. Leaderbord and automatic player sorting according to amount of right answers.
  10. Multiple sets of questions, players can choose a set, only if admin sets it (this was a task request).
